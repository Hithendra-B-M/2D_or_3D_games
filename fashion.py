/*This is clothes design game using python
A clothes design game in Python could involve the following elements:

1)A character creator that allows players to customize their avatars, including selecting different body types, skin tones, and hairstyles.

2)A wardrobe creator where players can design and create their own clothing items using a variety of tools and materials. This could include selecting colors, patterns, and textures, as well as adjusting the fit and style of the clothing.

3)A runway mode where players can showcase their designs by having their avatars model the clothes on a virtual runway.

4)A marketplace where players can sell their designs to other players and purchase designs created by others.

5)A social aspect where players can interact with each other, share designs and give feedback on each other's work.

6)A tutorial mode where players learn the basics of clothes design and fashion.

7)A level up system where players can unlock new tools and materials as they progress through the game.

8)A competition mode where players can compete with each other to see who can create the best designs.

All these features can be implemented using Python, as it has a large number of libraries for creating graphic user interface(GUI) and for handling images.*/

To create a clothes design game in Python, you will need to use libraries such as Pygame or Pyglet for creating the game's
graphical user interface (GUI) and handling input from the player.
You will also need to use libraries such as Pillow or OpenCV for handling images, allowing you to import and manipulate images of clothing and avatars.
You will also need to use object-oriented programming concepts in order to create classes for the different elements of the game, 
such as the player character, clothing items, and the marketplace.
Additionally, you will need to use database or file system to store the player data, designs, and market data.
It is important to have a solid understanding of programming concepts, such as classes, objects, functions, and
data structures, as well as a good understanding of the libraries you will be using.
I suggest you to break down the game into small parts, and develop one feature at a time.
Start with a simple prototype and incrementally add more features. And also consider taking online tutorials or
reading documentation for the libraries you are using to help you better understand how to use them to create your game.

NOTE:Code is complex hence the method of approaching is been said
